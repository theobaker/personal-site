## Theo's Personal Site
<<<<<<< HEAD
This is my website! I've tried to let people get to know me as best I can – there's a landing page, an aboutme/bio which includes a description as well as some of my more disparate hobbies, a writing page where you can check out a selection of some of my works, an experience page, and a CV. And, my favorite part, a currently reading section in the footer :) The site is built using Node.js/Vercel/React/Tailwind CSS and is deployed at https://theobaker.info. Thanks for checking out and reach out with any questions!
