              First Woman
            </div>
            This is result of my most recent independent project. "First Woman" is a novel in which Eleanor Roosevelt becomes President in 1945 instead of Harry Truman. 
            I spent the last few months researching this historical counterfactual in depth and writing. I'm also working on a corresponding miniseries of the same premise, titled "Mrs. R." I was invited by the Tang Institute to deliver a presentation about my work and hope to continue to push this surprisingly possible, and totally unexplored, alternate history.

            </div>
            This is a short story I wrote about Othello in which Iago scams his way through a state college he hasn't actually enrolled in. Part of a larger piece in which I transplant the characters from the play 
            into the cutthroat world of DC politics, this fragment follows Iago in events that take place before the beginning of Othello, establishing his manipulative ways and how he became the psychological torturer he is during the timeline of Othello.

            Tweets of mainstream House Republicans as well as a brief summation of the methodology. Conclusion: QAnon rhetoric in mainstream messaging increased 200% between 1/2019 and 1/2021, jumping with the release of the Mueller Report.

            This oped, written for the Phillipian, outlines my pedagogical views about reforming Andover's curriculum to better prepare students for a digital world. I include it here because I'm proud of its message and because I'm working this Spring, 
            as part of the Workshop at Andover, to implement some of its ideas in the real world.

              The Demagogues’ Club: Martin Dies and the Forgotten War on Democracy
            </div>
              This paper encompasses some of my research into Martin Dies, the now-obscure Southern Democrat who created the House Un-American Activities Committee. Dies was responsible for developing tactics of red-baiting and demagoguery which were later employed by McCarthy and are traceable even to Donald Trump. 
              He was also a chilling reflection of European dictatorships. Working against Roosevelt in the 1930s, Dies developed an ideology he termed "Americanism" which was equal parts Christian white supremacy and the authoritarianism which would so soon lead to World War II. Dies was successful at dismantling many New Deal programs and yet few know his name.

            I wrote this piece at a church school. Specifically, for a newspaper on the grounds of the largest cathedral in America. This piece, as intended, prompted widespread (and generally productive) dialogue about an often-unquestioned part of our community, and 
            it resulted in the largest ever comment section on an Exchanged article by a significant margin.

I spoke with Richard Primus, a well-regarded scholar from the University of Michigan Law School and former RBG clerk, and Joan Biskupic, the foremost Supreme Court biographer.
