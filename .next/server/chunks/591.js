I've also written guest essays, including one for The New York Times, and appeared on national TV including CNN, MSNBC, PBS NewsHour, Good Morning America, and more.",`My rigorously-sourced investigations have covered a number of topics. I've written about "Stanford's War on Fun" — the bureaucratic crackdown that has safety advocates, club leaders, and everyday students concerned. I've broken stories about a legendary genentics professor and a $30m fraud judgment Stanford pretended it had never heard of despite participating in the case. I've investigated a man who lived in dorms for a year, pretending to be a student and harassing several women all while Stanford knew about his presence and failed to warn residents. I've discovered missing Title IX data — and shifting excuses about where it went — and holes in Stanford's safety protocols. And so much more.`,"My most consequential, and most time-suckingly intense work, has been a series of investigative pieces about Stanford's now-former-president Marc Tessier-Lavigne, a billionaire neuroscientist. I exposed falsified data in his research and reported on his failures to correct the scientific record over a period of two decades. He resigned as a consequence. For that series of investigative pieces, which included a close look at studies that once claimed to have found the cause and a potential cure for Alzheimer's disease, I became the youngest ever recipient of one of journalism's highest prizes, the George Polk Award. (Past recipients include Bob Woodward and Carl Bernstein, Walter Cronkite, James Baldwin, and many other distinguished jouranlists.)","I'm not just a reporter, though.
