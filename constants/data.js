      "I'm a student with a burning curiosity about why we do what we do. Tackling this question has led me from humanities to CS to social science to somewhere in between, using the tools of many trades to answer universal questions.",

      `I'm a sixteen year old who never quite grew out of Montessori school. If ever there were a way to describe me, it would be that. I began coding when I was 10, spending time in dank college libraries with a student who was willing to tutor me.`,
      `In High School, I've rekindled my love for coding, using it as an extension of my research skills. I've taken on high-level social science projects using Machine Learning. I've also helped foster a vibrant community of dedicated programmers and curious minds alike as Co-President of Andover's large Computer Science Club.`,
      `I've created novel research about the influence of QAnon rhetoric on the Tweets of mainstream Republican Congressmen over time. I've also designed research about college students which was published in Axios. I've also written extensively, writing two full-length books (and in the middle of a third), numerous short stories, and countless articles in school newspapers. All of that led me to publish an op-ed in the Chicago Tribune earlier this year about AI ethics.`,
      `Ultimately, I love learning about different things and using the tools I pick up along the way to take on important research.`

Currently, I'm conducting an interdisciplinary Independent Project in History/English where I'm writing a counterfactual novel. I'm conducting another History/English project next term about post-Napoleonic European Literature, while simultaneously completing another Computer Science IP. And in the Spring, I've been accepted into Andover's hallowed school within a school â€“ The Workshop. The Workshop is a multidisciplinary opportunity which requires me to take no classes other than The Workshop, instead spending all of my time on the projects we produce. I hope to begin a longitudinal study on pedagogy which will continue after my departure.",
