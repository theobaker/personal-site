      `Hi there! My name is Theo (he/they) and I'm an undergraduate at Stanford University. As an investigative reporter, I've authored a number of national stories — most recently, my reporting into Stanford's billionaire president caused his resignation and made me the youngest ever recipient of the prestigious George Polk Award.`,
      `I love reading, writing, CS, and psychology! I've been trained as a social science researcher with expertise in public opinions and current affairs; more broadly, I believe in knowing more about the world, whether through anecdote or data (and ideally both).`

      "I'm a student with a burning curiosity about why we do what we do. Tackling this question has led me from humanities to CS to social science to somewhere in between, using the tools of many trades to answer universal questions.",

      `In the last year, I've written articles that have been viewed millions of times and been picked up by major media including The New York Times, The Washington Post, The Wall Street Journal, and other prominent papers. I've also written guest essays, including one for The New York Times, and appeared on national TV including CNN, MSNBC, PBS NewsHour, Good Morning America, and more.`,
      `My rigorously-sourced investigations have covered a number of topics. I've written about "Stanford's War on Fun" — the bureaucratic crackdown that has safety advocates, club leaders, and everyday students concerned. I've broken stories about a legendary genentics professor and a $30m fraud judgment Stanford pretended it had never heard of despite participating in the case. I've investigated a man who lived in dorms for a year, pretending to be a student and harassing several women all while Stanford knew about his presence and failed to warn residents. I've discovered missing Title IX data — and shifting excuses about where it went — and holes in Stanford's safety protocols. And so much more.`,
      `My most consequential, and most time-suckingly intense work, has been a series of investigative pieces about Stanford's now-former-president Marc Tessier-Lavigne, a billionaire neuroscientist. I exposed falsified data in his research and reported on his failures to correct the scientific record over a period of two decades. He resigned as a consequence. For that series of investigative pieces, which included a close look at studies that once claimed to have found the cause and a potential cure for Alzheimer's disease, I became the youngest ever recipient of one of journalism's highest prizes, the George Polk Award. (Past recipients include Bob Woodward and Carl Bernstein, Walter Cronkite, James Baldwin, and many other distinguished jouranlists.)`,
      `I'm not just a reporter, though. I've done election disinformation research; analyzed QAnon rhetoric and its similarity to tweets by Republican Congressmen; conducted national polling; helped to assemble one of the largest hackathons in the world, TreeHacks; helped teach classes on ethical Computer Science; and taken course material in everything from philosophy to systems engineering to Greek art history.`,
      `Ultimately, I've been extraordinarily lucky with the opportunities I've had and I hope I've done some cool things with them. Feel free to browse this website to take a look at some of my projects and reach out if you want to connect!`
