      `Hi there! My name is Theo (he/they) and I'm an undergraduate at Stanford University. My reporting has led to an investigation into Stanford's renowned neuroscientist president and made me the youngest ever recipient of the prestigious George Polk Award.`,
      `I love reading, writing, CS, and psychology! I'm a social science researcher with expertise in public opinions and current affairs and I believe in knowing more about the world, whether through anecdote or data (and ideally both).`

      "I'm a student with a burning curiosity about why we do what we do. Tackling this question has led me from humanities to CS to social science to somewhere in between, using the tools of many trades to answer universal questions.",

      `Recently 18, my writing has been picked up by CNN, AP, LA Times, Washington Post, CBS, Wall Street Journal, Good Morning America, Axios, Science, ABC, Daily Beast, Chicago Tribune, NBC, SF Chronicle, KQED, and more. I've exposed a professor for $30m of fraud, revealed that a man was pretending to be a student and harassing others for a year with Stanford's knowledge, reported on a "war on fun" that has students and administrators worried, and reported on allegedly falsified Alzheimer's research that was once thought worthy of a Nobel.`,
      `Currently an undergrad at Stanford, I'm having a blast exploring the incredible opportunities available to me. I live and breathe for the bright-minded builder circles that make things just for the hell of it. And at the same time, I'm dedicated to the History, Philosophy, and English classes that ground me in precedent.`,
      `I'm lucky enough to have built up the technical skills to keep up in techy ventures. TreeHacks, in particular, has been a fantastic experience. Working with a brilliant team of twenty-or-so students, I helped put on an event for 1,750 college students from around the world. Our shared goal is to find brilliant people of all different experience levels and provide them the opportunities to build cool things in cool areas (e.g. Sustainability, Healthcare, Education, etc.). That's why we pay for all of their travel and food expenses, provide hundreds of thousands of dollars in provided hardware and software, run dozens of workshops, and work with our 50+ sponsors to offer $160k in prizes.`,
      `I'm also a dedicated researcher. I've done work to analyze QAnon rhetoric and compare it to Congressional tweets using NLP tools; I've fielded national polls and published my results in Axios; I've contributed to research on election disinformation and cyber policy efforts; and I've spent countless hours in and out of archives studying the rise of populism in the 20th century.`,
      `Ultimately, I've been extraordinarily lucky with the opportunities I've had and I hope I've done some cool things with them.`

My very first article was referenced on the front page of the Wall Street Journal. I've broken stories about an reported $30m fraud verdict against a famous genenticist, a \"war on social life\" that has led to a decline in social events of all sorts and an increase in medical emergencies, a man who pretended to be a Stanford student for a year, living in dorms all the while Stanford knew of his presence and did not inform students, and plenty besides that.",
